# Cloud Design Patterns

## Circuit Breaker

### Description
The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used to handle failures in distributed systems. It acts like an electrical circuit breaker, protecting the system from cascading failures when a dependent service fails.

### Implementation
In our project, we have implemented the Circuit Breaker in two services:

1. **Auth API (Go)**:
   - Uses the `github.com/sony/gobreaker` package
   - Configuration:
     ```go
     settings := gobreaker.Settings{
         Name:        "auth-service",
         MaxRequests: 5,
         Interval:    0,
         Timeout:     5 * time.Second,
         ReadyToTrip: func(counts gobreaker.Counts) bool {
             return counts.ConsecutiveFailures > 3
         },
     }
     ```

2. **TODOs API (Node.js)**:
   - Uses the `circuit-breaker-js` library
   - Configuration:
     ```javascript
     const circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({
         failureThreshold: 3,
         resetTimeout: 5000,
         monitorInterval: 1000
     });
     ```

### Benefits
- Prevents cascading failures
- Improves system resilience
- Provides automatic recovery
- Reduces load on failed services

## Retry Pattern

### Description
The Retry pattern handles temporary failures by automatically retrying failed operations. It is particularly useful for handling transient network issues or temporary database locks.

### Implementation
In our project, we have implemented the Retry pattern in:

**Users API (Java/Spring Boot)**:
- Uses Spring Retry
- Configuration:
  ```java
  @Retryable(
      value = {SQLException.class},
      maxAttempts = 3,
      backoff = @Backoff(delay = 2000)
  )
  public User createUser(User user) {
      // User creation logic
  }
  ```

### Benefits
- Automatic handling of temporary failures
- Improves system reliability
- Reduces need for manual intervention
- Flexible retry policy configuration

## Bulkhead Pattern

### Description
The Bulkhead pattern isolates elements of an application into groups so that if one fails, the others continue to function. It is similar to bulkheads in a ship that prevent the entire ship from flooding if there is a leak.

### Implementation
In our project, we have implemented the Bulkhead pattern in:

**Log Message Processor (Python)**:
- Uses batch processing pattern
- Configuration:
  ```python
  class LogProcessor:
      def __init__(self, batch_size=100, max_workers=5):
          self.batch_size = batch_size
          self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers)
  ```

### Benefits
- Failure isolation
- Improved availability
- Resource control
- Enhanced scalability

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### Description
CQRS separates read and write operations into different models. This allows each model to be optimized for its specific purpose.

### Implementation
In our project, we have implemented CQRS in:

**TODOs API (Node.js)**:
- Command and query separation
- Optimized data models
- Example:
  ```javascript
  // Command
  async function createTodo(command) {
      // Creation logic
  }

  // Query
  async function getTodos(query) {
      // Read logic
  }
  ```

### Benefits
- Better performance
- Enhanced scalability
- Design flexibility
- Resource optimization

## Event Sourcing

### Description
Event Sourcing stores all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events. This allows reconstructing the current state and maintaining a complete history of changes.

### Implementation
In our project, we have implemented Event Sourcing in:

**Users API (Java/Spring Boot)**:
- Uses Axon Framework
- Configuration:
  ```java
  @Aggregate
  public class UserAggregate {
      @CommandHandler
      public void handle(CreateUserCommand command) {
          // Command handling logic
      }
  }
  ```

### Benefits
- Complete change history
- State reconstruction capability
- Better traceability
- Support for temporal analysis

## Conclusion
These cloud design patterns are fundamental for building resilient and scalable distributed systems. Their implementation in our project has significantly improved the reliability and performance of our microservices.
